# Accident-Severity-Analysis-and-Prediction

Dataset from : https://www.kaggle.com/akshay4/road-accidents-incidence

A prediction system for an IoE(Internet of Everything) project, whose topic is 'Smart Street Light'. The system has two sensors - LDR(Light Dependent Resistor) and IR(Infrared) sensors. Inputs that can be measured using these sensors have been used in building this prediction model.

The Smart Street Light provides the following functionalities:
1. Detecting Overspeeding (by recording activity through IR sensors)
2. Detecting Accidents and Road Blockages (by recording activity through IR sensors)
3. Prediction of Accident Severity in a particular area based on some parameters (in jupyter notebook)
